# Zoom out the Ethereum's Storage Layout

While I was learning the process of verification in Optimism, the question "How the state in calldata looks like?" just kept buzzing in my head. So this article will solve all the mysterious stuff behind the fancy words of "Merkle Trie" or "Merkle Patricia Trie" once and for all ðŸ˜¤.

# Contract storage

All statically-sized variables are laid out contiguously on **storage slots**. Each storage slot has its own index, which runs from $0$ to $2^{256}-1$, and points to a big-endian 32-bytes storage. Multiple statically-sized variables (except struct and array) could stored in a slot if they all fit in. However, struct and array always take new slots and their elements are follow the aforementioned rules. In case of contract inheritance, it will follow [C3 linearization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization).

Dynamically-sized variables including mapping and dynamic array use a Keccak-256 hash to find the starting position. With an array at position `p`, the slot `p`-th will store the number of elements in the array and the array data will locate at `keccak256(p)`. With a mapping at position `p`, the slot `p`-th will be empty, and the data of key `k` will locate at `keccak256(k|p)`
, where `|` is concatenation.

For example,

```solidity label="layout.sol" group="layout"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.7.0;

contract C {
    struct S { uint a; uint b; } // This is a data type, not a variable
    uint x; // The storage slot #0
    mapping(uint => mapping(uint => S)) data; // The storage slot #1 is empty
}
```

The slot of `data[4][9]` will start at:

$$
x = \textcolor{red}{keccak256(uint256(9) | \textcolor{green}{keccak256(uint256(4) | uint256(1))})}
$$

Additionally, the data of `data[4][9].a` is locate at $x$, and the data of `data[4][9].b` is locate at $x+1$.

All these knowledges is not really interesting. The thing we must notice is that the contract storage is a strip of 32-byte length slots. They key is a 32-byte integer and the value is a [RLP-encoded](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/rlp/) 32-byte integer.

# Account State

The account state consists of $nonce$, $balance$, $storageRoot$, and $codeHash$. Focusing on $storageRoot$, it stores the root hash of [Merkle Patricia Trie](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/) (MPT). We know that for a pair of $(key, value)$, the key represents the path and the value is the leaf content in MPT. Mapping the knowledge into the [Contract Storage](#contract-storage), a storage slot `p` with `value` is encoded to a pair of `(keccak256(p), RLP(value))` and added to the MPT.
