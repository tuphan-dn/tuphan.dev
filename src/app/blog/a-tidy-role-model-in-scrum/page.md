# A tidy role model in Scrum

_Scrum is an agile method for software development. In this article, we focus on the roles and its scopes in a small team. Vietnamese is available below._

![Scrum Process](./scrum-process.jpg)

## Product Owner (PO)

They can be users, developers, or anyone with ideas to improve the product. They must create an issue ticket to explain the features completely.

In a project, we may need one PO.

## Project Manager (PM)

> Some documents mention them as Scrum Masters

They're mastered and able to run the Scrum structure. In addition, they also train new developers to be familiar with Scrum and help them to experience it.

In a project, we need one PM.

## Developers

It's a broad concept and SHOULD NOT limit it to just a group of people coding. The developer means coders, designers, marketers, advisors, etc. whoever can consume issue tickets.

In a project, we need multiple developers.

# The great story

**The PO** will generate issue tickets throughout the whole project life. They don't have to follow any iteration but the issue ticket meaning:

- Title: `<Do> <something>`
- Description: `As a <user, developer>, I <do> <something> to <occur> <something>.`

Biweekly, **the PM** convert the drafts to complete issues by defining the _due date_, _priority_, _repository_, and _label_ at the iteration's beginning on Wednesday. Developers will take and assign themselves to the issues.

**Developers** will estimate the point (we can gamify it by the planning poker) and create a dedicated branch for each issue. Move it to In Process, In Review, and Done accordingly.
